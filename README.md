# Gather Dance Party
This node.js script generates a Gather space with 35 monitors playing iconic music from the 90s.

This uses https://github.com/gathertown/api-examples as a starting point.

Make sure to replace the data in `config.js` with your own. i.e. API keys can be generated [here](https://gather.town/apiKeys)
